Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java is a powerful paradigm that allows you to design and structure your code around objects. Let’s break down the key concepts:

Classes and Objects:
A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. 
It defines the properties (also known as fields) and behaviors (also known as methods)
that the objects of that class will have.
An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object,
 it inherits all the characteristics (fields and methods) defined in its class.

Advantages of OOP in Java:
Modularity:
OOP promotes breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable objects.
Each object encapsulates its own state and behavior.

Reusability:
Once you’ve defined a class, you can create multiple objects from it. 
This reusability reduces redundancy and makes your code more efficient.

Maintainability: 
OOP encourages a clear structure. 
Changes or updates to one part of the code (e.g., a class) don’t necessarily impact other parts,
making maintenance easier.

Abstraction:
You can hide the implementation details of a class and expose only what’s necessary. This simplifies the interaction with objects.

Inheritance:
Classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. 
It allows you to create a hierarchy of related classes.

The Four Pillars of OOP:
Abstraction:
Representing essential features without exposing unnecessary details. 
For example, a Vehicle class can represent any vehicle type (car, bike, etc.) without specifying the exact details of each.

Encapsulation: 
Bundling data (fields) and methods (behavior) together within a class.
Access modifiers (public, private, etc.) control the visibility of these components.

Inheritance: 
Creating a new class based on an existing one.
The new class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors from the existing class (superclass or base class).

Polymorphism:
The ability of objects to take on multiple forms. It allows you to use a single interface (method or class) to represent different types of objects
